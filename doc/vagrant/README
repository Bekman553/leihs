## The leihs Vagrant virtual machine


### What you can do with this

You can use this virtual machine to *develop* leihs. This is not meant as
a production environment. It merely wants to *mirror* the production
environment that we recommend for leihs, so that developers can catch
errors more easily thanks to a development environment that is similar
to the production one.

You need VirtualBox to use this machine:

https://www.virtualbox.org/


### Starting the Vagrant machine

In the leihs source directory:

  vagrant up

Then SSH into the Vagrant machine:

  vagrant ssh

And if it's the first time you set up this machine, you also need to do:

  bash /vagrant/vagrant-setup.sh

Inside the guest machine, as user 'vagrant'.


### Networking

This guest machine expects to find a DHCP server on the same network as
one of your host machine's network interfaces is connected to.

If you have no DHCP server, you can still use the guest machine, but
only through port forwarding.

If you do have a DHCP server, the IP address assigned to that interface
will be shown to you after you start the virtual machine. You then
have the choice to connect either directly to the virtual machine's
DHCP-assigned IP address or through port forwarding.

The following ports are forwarded:

  Guest       Your machine
  -----       ------------
  80          8080
  22          2222
  3000        30000
  5901        55901

So if you want to connect to e.g. a development Rails server on the
guest, connect to port 30000 of localhost on your host.


### Initial setup of leihs

Once you have the guest machine running, you need to have databases:

  cd /vagrant
  bundle
  bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed


### Setting up a hostname on your host machine

You will need to edit your hosts file (or whatever mechanism your
operating system uses for hostname lookups) so that you can access
the virtual host on the guest in which leihs runs. For example:

  192.168.1.110    leihs.vagrant

The domain name is important! leihs is *only* listening on the virtual
host 'leihs.vagrant'. Anything else won't work.


### Running graphical tests

To run any browser-based tests that use Firefox, you need to first
start some sort of X server on the guest. We recommend and include
tightvncserver:

  tightvncserver

The first time you run this, it will ask you to specify a password.
You use this password to connect from your host machine to the guest
using a VNC client.

Once tightvncserver is running, you need to tell your logged-in session
which display to use. By default, you need to export :1 as display
address:

  export DISPLAY=:1

From now on, you can run any graphical tests on that console session
and see the display result (e.g. a browser window) in your VNC client.


### Production mode

Don't forget that the leihs application at http://leihs.vagrant is running
in production mode! You will have to precompile assets and make sure
that the 'production' database exists and is migrated and seeded, otherwise
none of this will work properly.
